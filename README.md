<h1  align="center">Italiani alle urne: come si schiera la comunità italiana di Twitter riguardo le #ElezioniPolitiche22</h1>

  

<h2  align="center">Social media analytics project</h2>

  

  
  

The project consists in the analysis of Italian tweets related to the Italian election of 2022. Through this analysis is possible to understand how the popular opionion is polarized around this subject and who are the most influential actors in play. Some questions are at the base of the project: is the political division of the country reflected in the Twitter community? Is it possible to find interesting communities from tweets? Which are the sentiments around the most important people in race for the election? In order to answer these questions different algorithms were employed, some to analyze the social network and others to investigate the sentiments and emotions of the texts.

The data was downloaded using the Twitter APIs, considering only a few days of tweets all containing some hastags related to the Italian election. Some pre-processing was needed in order to make the dataset usable by the algorithms. Also, some tweets containing the names of the top five parties were downloaded in order to run some specific analysis.

You can check out the full paper (available only in Italian) describing all the steps in great detail at: [Italiani alle urne: come si schiera la comunità italiana di Twitter riguardo le #ElezioniPolitiche22](https://github.com/andreamaver/SocialMediaAnalytics/blob/main/Report_SMA_Maver_Palomba_Zanotti.pdf "Report_SMA_Maver_Palomba_Zanotti.pdf").

In the [Data](https://github.com/andreamaver/SocialMediaAnalytics/tree/main/Data) folder all the files .csv files used for the project can be found; in the [Notebook](https://github.com/andreamaver/SocialMediaAnalytics/tree/main/Notebook) one the Python notebooks used to download the data from the APIs and to run the analysis can be found.
